#lightski's dotfiles
##About
Super basic dotfiles repo
Tracks my basic configs for:
- git
- vim
- zsh

Other solutions seemed very heavy-handed for this, so I opted for a barebones shell script.
Note you will need to install these tools on your system. This repo is only configuration.

##Usage
I do not recommend cloning and using these willy-nilly. 
You are better off reading my configurations and taking a line here or there.
Please be *sure* you know what you're doing before installing this!

If you insist on installing:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run install.sh
	sudo chmod u+x install.sh
	./install.sh
3. Open a new shell to see effects

##Disclaimer
Use these configs however you like; I am not responsible for what you do.
