# lightski's dotfiles
## About
Super basic dotfiles repository. Tracks my basic configs for:
- git
- vim
- zsh

Other solutions seemed heavy-handed for this, so I opted for a barebones shell script.
Note you will need to install the tools on your system. This repo is only configuration.

## Usage
I do NOT recommend cloning and using this repository (unless you are me??!). 
You are better off reading my configurations and taking a line here or there.
Please be **sure** you know what you're doing before installing this!

If you insist on installing:

1.	 Clone this repo (preferably into ~/.dotfiles)
2.	 Run install.sh
	```
		chmod u+x install.sh && ./install.sh
	```
3.	 Open a new shell to see effects

## TODO
[]Refactor vim configuration? Could increase modularity by adding individual files to .vim/config/

## Disclaimer
Use these configs however you like; I am not responsible for what you do.
