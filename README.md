# lightski's dotfiles
## About
Super basic dotfiles repository. Tracks my basic configs for:
- git
- vim
- zsh

Other solutions seemed heavy-handed for this, so I opted for a barebones shell script.
These configuraitons have only been tested on Arch Linux but *should* work elsewhere.

## Installation
0.	Have git, vim, and zsh with oh-my-zsh.
1.	Clone this repo (preferably into ~/.dotfiles)
2.	Run install.sh
	```
		chmod u+x install.sh && ./install.sh
	```
3.	Open a new shell to see effects

## TODO
*	Refactor vim configuration? Make more individual files in .vim/*.vim/
*	???

## Disclaimer
Use these configs however you like; I am not responsible for what you do.
